# Sanity Blog App

Sanity blog App is a simple responsive application for posting blogs. Actually, I was learning to use a CMS called Sanity. The project was made using [Next JS](https://nextjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

First, you can clone the project using git bash.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EchegoyenGE/sanityblogapp.git

## Usage

You have to sign up in [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/). Then, you can get the credentials you need to connect your project.

## Deployment

The final project was deployed on Vercel.
